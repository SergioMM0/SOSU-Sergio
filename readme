Danish SOSU schools are the association for schools that offer social and health education. The association has 15 member schools with several departments in their local area so that a good geographical spread is ensured in the supply of social and health educations among Denmark.

SOSU schools offer different type of courses to their students such as Social and health care professional (Social- og sundhedshjælper), Social and health assistant (Social- og sundhedsassistent) and Teaching assistant (Pædagogisk assistent) and SOSU’s educational model is strongly oriented toward practice and work hand by hand with real citizens.

SOSU’s educational model is based on Fallesprog 3 (FSIII) which is a new common standard for recording data in the field of health and the elderly. This common standard covers the different diseases and disabilities that may exist and classifies them into different categories sorted by different areas of classification.

In order to provide a realistic experience to their students, the SOSU Association requested the Danish Healthcare Services to provide them with access to the applications that are being used in real life such as ‘Nexus’ and ‘Cura’ so their students could approach and have a close experience with the tools that are being used in real life when assessing patients but this petition was unfortunately refused.

The overall purpose of the project is to qualify the students at the country's SOSU schools to understand and apply documentation systems with a special focus on Common Language III (FSIII) in a practice-oriented environment. The work with the digital platform must give the students competencies in relation to the systematic use of digital tools. 

They wanted to establish a digital platform where students can work with realistic cases and the students, in this connection, have the opportunity to practice concepts and work with classifications in a "sandbox environment" that includes the ability to create fictitious citizens.


With this application we want to ensure that the students of SOSU will have an application where they will get in touch with the FSIII common language while at the same time allow them to get in touch with an application closely related to the systems that they will encounter in their future professional career.
